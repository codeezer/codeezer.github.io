    <p>I have always found it fascinating how things we take for granted, like a simple semiconductor where 0.7 volts creates a junction, build up into complex systems. From that, we get transistors, chips, computers, networks, and the digital systems shaping our lives. During my undergrad, this curiosity about how tiny, precise things create massive outcomes led me to computer networks. In graduate school, I ended up deep in formal methods, studying how systems can be logically verified for correctness and safety. Somewhere along the way, philosophy kept showing up. I never planned to chase it, but it never left.</p>

    <p>One idea that kept resurfacing was Gödel’s incompleteness theorem. On the surface, it belongs to mathematics, a discipline we like to believe is clean, precise, and absolute. Gödel proved that in any formal system complex enough to describe basic arithmetic, there will be true statements that cannot be proven within that system. It shattered the old dream of mathematics as a flawless, closed system of truth. For many, this felt like a defeat. If even mathematics, the purest of our logical tools, is incomplete, what hope do we have for any system built on top of it?</p>

    <p>But I never saw it that way. To me, incompleteness is an opportunity. It means that our universe still has unanswered questions. It leaves space for the unknown, for discovery, for the human need to keep reaching. If everything were answerable, if every system were complete, there would be no mystery left. No reason to build or think beyond what already exists. Incompleteness is not a flaw in mathematics or in reasoning systems, it is a feature of the universe.</p>

    <p>This idea has direct parallels to how we understand the human mind. Consciousness, the experience of being aware, is not something we can fully explain through logic or formal systems. The brain follows physical laws, neurons fire, and signals move, but somewhere along that process emerges experience. This is what philosophers call the hard problem of consciousness. It may be one of those truths Gödel hinted at, something fundamentally unreachable from inside the system we inhabit.</p>

    <p>The same tension exists in how humans have thought about the idea of God. Gödel himself believed that the limitations of logic pointed toward a transcendent reality. He even attempted a formal logical proof for God’s existence, taking inspiration from Leibniz. Others, like Albert Camus, looked at the silence of the universe and called it absurd. Camus argued that the universe offers no inherent meaning, yet we continue to demand it. He believed the struggle itself gave life value, that meaning is created through rebellion against meaninglessness.</p>

    <p>This way of thinking turns incompleteness from a limitation into a reason to continue. It is not a cause for despair but a permission to ask more questions. It reflects what it means to be human. We live in a world where some truths cannot be proven, where some experiences cannot be measured, and where ultimate answers may never arrive. Yet, we still build systems of thought, science, and art. We search for meaning, knowing it may never fully be within our grasp.</p>

    <p>And maybe it is this very incompleteness that makes life and the pursuit of knowledge worth it.</p>
